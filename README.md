Workspace for NLP Course 21/22 of M.Sc. in Machine Learning &amp; Big Data @uniparthenope.

## Assignment n.1
### Text Normalization using NLTK Library
* Prepare Jupiter notebooks for explaining text normalization using NLTK library
  * Corpus loading
  * Corpus statistics
  * Tokenization
  * Lemmatization
  * Stemming

---

## Assignment n.2
### Sentiment Analysis
 * Prepare Jupiter notebooks for explaining Sentiment Analysis with Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic regression
 * Also, consider any preprocessing step
 * It would be possible to use any python library for NLP e for Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and numerical computation (e.g., scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy)

## Assignment n.3
### Auto-Complete using N-Gram Language Models
* Prepare Jupiter Notebooks for explaining Auto-Complete operation using N-Gram Language Models:

1. Load and preprocess data
    * Load and tokenize data.
    * Split the sentences into train and test sets.
    * Replace words with a low frequency by an unknown marker <unk>.
2. Develop N-gram based language models
    * Compute the count of n-grams from a given data set.
    * Estimate the conditional probability of a next word with k-smoothing.
3. Evaluate the N-gram models by computing the perplexity score.
4. Use your own model to suggest an upcoming word given your sentence
